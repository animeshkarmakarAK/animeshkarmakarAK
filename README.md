Software Enginnering knowledge:
🧱 Design & Architecture Principles
KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):
Simplicity leads to fewer bugs and easier maintenance.

DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself):
Avoid code duplication; reuse logic and modules.

SOLID Principles:

Separation of Concerns:
Each module or layer should have a distinct responsibility.

YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It):
Don’t add functionality until it’s necessary.

High Cohesion, Low Coupling:
Modules should be self-contained but loosely connected.

🧩 Code Quality & Maintainability

Write self-documenting code — clear names and logic reduce the need for extra comments.

Refactor regularly — keep code clean and remove technical debt.

Automate testing — ensure reliability and prevent regressions.

Version control everything — maintain a clean Git workflow.

Code reviews matter — learn from peers and maintain consistency.

⚙️ Performance & Scalability

Optimize only when needed — premature optimization adds complexity.

Design for scalability — plan for future growth in traffic and data.

Use asynchronous and parallel processing wisely.

🔒 Reliability & Security

Validate all inputs — never trust external data.

Handle errors gracefully — always provide fallback paths.

Secure by design — consider authentication, authorization, and data protection from the start.

👥 Collaboration & Process

Follow Agile principles — deliver iteratively and gather feedback.

Document decisions — future engineers should understand “why,” not just “what.”

Communicate clearly — align with stakeholders early and often.

Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) — automate builds, tests, and deployments.
